⚙️ Backend Setup

The extension communicates with a FastAPI backend that processes email content and generates replies using Ollama.

Ensure Ollama is running with the desired model:

ollama run llama3.1:latest

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

4. Configure the Extension

Open Thunderbird’s Add-on settings for the AI Reply Generator.

Enter the FastAPI server URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000/generate-reply).

Optionally, provide an API key if configured in the backend.

🚀 Usage

Click the Generate AI Reply button in the email composer toolbar.
